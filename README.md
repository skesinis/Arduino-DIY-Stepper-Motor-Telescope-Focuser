- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects, as well as Python and C/C++ projects too.
- This project is an Arduino driven 28YBT-48 DC 5V stepper motor, using a ULN2003 driver.
- It's used to turn the focuser of my telescope without touching and wobbling the telescope, while it's giving an accuracy of less than 1/10 of a degree.
- The stepper motor has only 64 steps, but it has an embedded gearbox, dividing them by 64, so it takes 4096 steps to complete a 360Âº.
